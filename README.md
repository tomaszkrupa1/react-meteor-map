## Conclusion

### Why we built this project this way?

Me and my partner decided to make the app this way in order to experiment with displaying information visually within React. In order to do this we used NASA's API information, and visualised it using Leaflet maps, while giving the user the option to refine their search within the React app.

### I gained confidence...

I have gained confidence in REST API usage, and data visualisation, alongside some basic styling principles to make the app interactive.

### If we had more time...

If we had more time we'd like to replace the slide buttons with a slider.
